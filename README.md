# AccountingLedgerApplication

Application starts with creating a csv file for the user and then it prompts the user to choose between two types of transactions (payment/deposit) or show a ledger screen. The ledger screen is where the user can view all their transactions and is able to filter them by type. Both payment and deposit use the created Transaction class that needs a date, time, description, vendor, amount and type.
